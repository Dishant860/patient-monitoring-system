# Uphar
I have created this patient monitoring web-application using python with Django framework.

At first, download Uphar 2.zip file and unzip in your device.
Open your code editor and open Uphar 2 folder.
Go Live to your code editor.
Run manage.py file using this code " python manage.py runserver " (make sure you installed python Language in your code editor) 
open your favourite browser and type " http://127.0.0.1/ " in search bar. Hit the Enter.
Now the Project is Ready for working.
You can use " http://127.0.0.1/admin " in search bar of browser to access admin panel of the project. with the help of admin panel you can manage whole project.
The admin panel username: admin & password: admin
if upper password is not work use this password:" admin1234 " or " admin123 " instead of.
